# Q2-ERC-ASSIGNMENT
I STARTED WITH 
[[[ this has my solution for q2 of the erc convener assignment. i have used matlab as i had done some basic work on it before, and also because it provides direct functions to implement different tasks including the fast fourier transform which made my life a hell lot easier. i used the online version.

firstly, i imported the audio into matlab and was confused about how to proceed. then i watched different videos to understand the discrete fourier transform first, and then the fast fourier transform. i also referred to stuff online to understand how to code that on matlab. it was difficult and i genuinely donâ€™t remember all the syntax and exact code, but i do know what is happening in every function and each step of the code.

then i moved on to demodulating it (watched yt videos to understand modulation and demodulation), and then worked on clearing the noise. since human speech is between 500 to 3000 hz, i implemented a low pass filter with a cutoff of 3000 hz and saved the audio. i also generated different plots using the figure function as mentioned in the instructions.]]]


BUT APPAREENTLY THIS WAS TRASH AS I WAS NOT ABLE HEAR ANYTHING.SO THEN I TRIED FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS WITH DIFFERENT METHODS AND DIFFERENT LOW PASS AND BAND PASS FILTERS BUT NOT MUCH HELP. THEN I APPLIED THE BAND PASS DIRECTLY ON THE MODULATED WAVE AS I KNEW THE CARRIER FREQUNCY IS 10000 AND THEN DEMODULATED AND LOW PASS FILTER. THIS WORKS PRETTY FINE I GUESS AND I AM ABLE TO LISTEN TO THE MEME OF THAT MAN LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY
